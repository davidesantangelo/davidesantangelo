### Hi there 👋 I'm Davide Santangelo

I have a lot of experience in web development. I have the ability to solve many problems and I use different approaches and solutions in my projects. I'm in love with Ruby and Go.

I have a deep understanding of REST API integration and have worked extensively with APIs to create powerful, scalable web applications. I believe that a strong API architecture is essential to the success of any web project, and I am committed to delivering solutions that are both elegant and robust.

I have honed and refined my skills on a daily basis, working in very different environments with many different technologies.
